# Whatsapp-Chat-Analyser
## Description
The WhatsApp Chat Analyzer is a great tool for anyone who wants to gain insights into their messaging habits, communication patterns, and social interactions. The project is easy to use, customizable, and provides valuable insights that can be used to improve personal or professional relationships and even for **fun**. The code is available on GitHub under an open-source license, making it accessible to anyone who wants to use or modify the project for their own needs.

The features of the project include the ability to extract and visualize chat data such as message frequency, message length, time of day analysis, and word frequency analysis. The project also includes word cloud generation to help users understand the content of their conversations.
It is an ongoing project and am working on further improvements.
