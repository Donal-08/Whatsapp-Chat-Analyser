2/26/23, 6:39 PM - Abhay Biomed: Hey all!

We are proud to announce that Epoch is collaborating with TL to organise a Machine Learning Hackathon open to the student community. So ML enthusiasts, put on your thinking hats, and start "networking" away. [ reference to Neural Networks:) ] 

You can find the PS here.

Link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fjYSDLiyjajfUuN6uehUYKx39h-_jIzd9TE3wr2FLeY/edit?usp=sharing

Now hold up! We don't want to spoil the entire thing now, do we? The doc shared above is merely a general overview of how the PS would be. We will have an elaborate presentation of the PS, with all the finer details for the ones who register.

So, what are you waiting for? Register here.

Link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfK3Cs6Qp_GOG9ek6z5fSriI_NhnwXjPTKMI5E0Ccs40bvTnA/viewform?usp=sf_link

We will have cash prizes of up to Rs. 5000 for the winners. Note that we are also in discussion with Professors to guide this project, so the one with the best model will get a chance to work on the end-to-end implementation of this entire system, under the guidance of a Prof.

P.S. We know B.Tech freshers might be feeling a bit intimidated by the technical details of this problem statement, and wondering if they have what it takes to win. To put these fears to rest, freshers who impress us with their work will get a special prize on behalf of Epoch and TL.

Cheers, and hoping to see some great participation!
